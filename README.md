# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

I'm excited to share one of the most complete projects I’ve built around **data engineering and analytics**. This repository showcases how I designed and implemented a **modern data warehouse** solution, following industry best practices and using the **Medallion Architecture**.

This project was created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my hands-on experience in building a data warehouse from scratch, transforming raw data, and turning it into business insights.

## 🏗️ My Data Architecture

I followed the **Medallion Architecture** approach with three key layers:

### 🔹 Bronze Layer
- **Raw ingestion layer**  
- Stores data exactly as it arrives from the source system (CSV files).
- Data is first ingested into a **SQL Server Database** without transformations.

### 🔸 Silver Layer
- **Cleansed and transformed layer**  
- Data is cleaned, standardized, and normalized here.
- Prepares the dataset for analytical use and joins necessary tables.

### 🟡 Gold Layer
- **Business-ready layer**  
- Data is modeled into a **Star Schema** for reporting and analytics.
- Optimized for fast queries and used for dashboards and reports.
